I used Michal Kowalski simulator which now seems to be hard to find at least this version. 
So after some hunting i found version 1.3.3, which seems to be the latest 6502 simulator. 

I've included it here for ease of access. 

Kevin Wilson contributed documents describing 6502 architecture, basics of using the simulator plus exercises. 
Those documents are free for any educational or nonprofit activity. See http://exifpro.com/utils.html
